This repository contains 3 datasets files for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on sentence-level temporal reasoning:

- `MT_shuffled.csv`: Mixed-time setting. Some absolute time expressions are rewritten into relative expressions using a GPT-based rewriting strategy.
- `AT_shuffled_cleaned.csv`: Absolute-time setting. Events are ordered by their original timestamps without modification.
- `conversion_table.csv`: Conversion Table. Provides a list of time expression rewrites extracted from the `MT_shuffled.csv` dataset. 
                          - It maps absolute time expressions to their corresponding GPT-generated relative or descriptive alternatives. 
                          - This table can be used as a reference for studying time expression rewriting, paraphrasing, or time grounding in temporal reasoning tasks.
  
Each file contains passages extracted from Wikipedia biographies, with gold-standard sentence order annotations and corresponding model inputs.

## 📑 Column Descriptions

Below are the descriptions of each column included in the released `.csv` files (`MT_shuffled.csv` and `AT_shuffled.csv`):

| Column Name                         | Description |
|------------------------------------|-------------|
| `Wikidata ID`                      | The unique identifier of the entity on Wikidata (e.g., Q937). |
| `Name`                             | The full name of the person described in the passage. |
| `Professions`                      | The profession(s) associated with the person, as retrieved from Wikidata. |
| `Wikipedia Title`                  | The title of the Wikipedia page where the biographical text was sourced. |
| `pageContent`                      | The original passage, composed of biographical event sentences extracted from Wikipedia. |
| `clean text`                       | A cleaned version of `pageContent`, with preprocessed formatting and sentence segmentation. |
| `gold answer`                      | The gold chronological order of the sentences (e.g., `0 1 2 3`), used for evaluation. |
| `event_count`                      | The number of event sentences in the passage (e.g., 4 or 10), used for data grouping and analysis. |

### Columns specific to `MT_shuffled.csv`:

| Column Name                         | Description |
|------------------------------------|-------------|
| `Gpt Modified Context`             | The version of the passage in which some absolute time expressions are rewritten into relative expressions using GPT (e.g., “in 1945” → “at the end of World War II”). |
| `Replacement Information`          | Metadata describing which time expressions were replaced and how. Useful for understanding the transformation process. |
| `Shuffled Gpt Modified Context`    | A shuffled version of the modified passage used as the actual model input for temporal ordering tasks. |
| `Shuffle Mapping`                  | A mapping from the shuffled sentence indices to the original order, used to calculate evaluation metrics. |

### Columns specific to `AT_shuffled.csv`:

| Column Name                         | Description |
|------------------------------------|-------------|
| `Shuffled gold answer`             | The `clean text` passage with its sentences randomly shuffled for model input. |
| `Shuffle Mapping gold answer`      | A mapping from the shuffled indices to the original gold order for use in evaluation. |


### Columns in `conversion_table_fully_cleaned.csv`:

| Column Name     | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `Original Time`  | The original absolute time expression (e.g., `1945`, `March 2002`, `1990 to 1995`). |
| `Rewritten Time` | The rewritten or paraphrased version generated by GPT (e.g., `the end of World War II`, `over a decade ago`). |

### ⚠️ Known Limitations

While most rewritten expressions are semantically meaningful and contextually grounded, **not all rewrites are globally valid**:

- ✅ Some expressions (e.g., `1945 → the end of World War II`) are historically anchored and widely interpretable.
- ⚠️ Others (e.g., `1945 → three years ago`) are context-dependent and only make sense relative to the document’s internal timeline.

> 📌 Please refer to the original passage (`Gpt Modified Context`) in `MT_shuffled.csv` when using these rewrites for downstream tasks such as generation, normalization, or alignment.
